career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      After primarily working in retail and sales since leaving sixth form, I was
      presented with the chance to take on a 12 month secondment in User
      Acceptance Testing for web development. Following returning to my full
      time position in holiday sales, I was made redundant and decided to
      take that opportunity to further pursue my interest in software engineering.
education:
    - degree: BEng Software Engineering with Foundation Year
      university: Canterbury Christ Church University
      time: 2020 - present
      details: |
        I'm currently studying for my degree in Software Engineering, havin successfully passed my foundation year in 2021.
        I have the following coding knowledge thus far:
          - Python (Basic)
          - C# (Basic)
          - SQL (Basic)

experiences:
    - role: User Acceptance Tester
      time: 2019 - 2020
      company: Saga Plc, Folkestone
      details: |
        I entered this role with no previous experience, however I was
        able to self teach how to interpret SDLC documentation, effectively
        write and run test cases, complete sanity checks for live releases,
        and also write process documentation for system testing.
        I also became the testing expert for Sitecore tests in a 
        team of experienced testers by communicating well with developers
        and taking the time to fully understand the system and how it was
        used within the company. In this time I also learnt fundamental
        SQL skills to allow me to manipulate databases for projects.
