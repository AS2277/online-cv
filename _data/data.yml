career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      After primarily working in retail and sales since leaving sixth form, I was
      presented with the chance to take on a 12 month secondment in User
      Acceptance Testing for web development. Following returning to my full
      time position in holiday sales, I was made redundant and decided to
      take that opportunity to further pursue my interest in software engineering.
      I currently retain a retail position as a casual assistant while completing
      my degree.
education:
    - degree: BEng Software Engineering with Foundation Year
      university: Canterbury Christ Church University
      time: 2020 - present

        I'm currently studying for my degree in Software Engineering, havin successfully passed my foundation year in 2021.
        I have the following coding knowledge thus far:
          - Python (Basic)
          - C# (Basic)
          - SQL (Basic)

experiences:
    - role: User Acceptance Tester
      time: 2019 - 2020
      company: Saga Plc, Folkestone
      details: |
        I entered this role with no previous experience, however I was
        able to self teach how to interpret SDLC documentation, effectively
        write and run test cases, complete sanity checks for live releases,
        and write process documentation for system testing.
        During my secondment I became the testing expert for Sitecore tests in 
        a team of experienced testers by communicating well with developers
        and taking the time to fully understand the system and how it was
        used within the company. In this time I also learnt fundamental
        SQL skills to allow me to manipulate databases for projects.
